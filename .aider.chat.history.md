#### Code the following app

#### Write a basic Python chatbot that responds with simple pre-defined answers  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – to generate a new logo image.  
3. **mini-app/scripts/chatbot.py** – a new Python script that implements the simple chatbot.

Please add these three files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

A stylized chat bubble in blue with a white Python snake inside, set against a light gray background. The chat bubble has rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow, giving a friendly and modern look. The Python snake is centered within the bubble, its body forming a subtle 'P' shape, with a small tail curling to the right. The overall composition is clean and minimal, suitable for a chatbot application.
